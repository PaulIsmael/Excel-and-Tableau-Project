## This is my first Data Analyst Project

- **Data: Wealth of Nations Project**

# Project Summary

This GitHub repository showcases my data analysis skills through a project centered on the "Wealth of Nations" dataset. The project involves data cleaning, data transformation, and data visualization using Excel and Tableau.

## Key Highlights:

- **Data Cleaning**: In Excel, I meticulously cleaned the "Wealth of Nations" dataset, addressing missing values, outliers, and ensuring data quality.

- **Data Transformation**: I applied data transformation techniques to reshape and structure the data for meaningful insights and analysis.

- **Data Visualization**: Using Tableau, I created a dynamic dashboard that visually represents the transformed data, making it accessible and actionable.

This project serves as a testament to my data analyst skills and my ability to convert raw data into valuable insights and visualizations.
